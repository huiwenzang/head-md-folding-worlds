## Sensing the invisible

"The visible is subordinated to the higher purpose of making sensible of what is absent". Through this project, we aim to create an ecosystem of "missing things" that will envision an intersecion where the trace of passage coexists with the reality of nature's decay, forshadowing the fragile state of the living world and its temoporal essence.
