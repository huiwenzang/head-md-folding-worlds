## Last Bee Standing

You are a bee that hasn't been home in a long time and decide to come back. As you arrive in the garden where your hive resides
you discover that everything has died while you were away. You pick up a remain of the garden and burry it in the ground as a last homage. While the water of your tears of nostalgia touch the soil, you realise with that the remain had regrown into a beautiful flower. You decide to do the same with the other remains. Soon tears of sadness become tears of joy as you realise that everytime a plant is reborn, the main tree and your hive are being restored : slowly leafs are appearing again on the branches and bees start to come back. Together you start rebuilding this garden until it's as lush and marvelous as it was before you left.
