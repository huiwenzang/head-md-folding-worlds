## Last Bee Standing

You are a bee who returns home after a long while and finds everything has died in the garden where your hive resides. You pay your last homage with tears in eyes. However, as the tears fall to the ground, the remains miraculously regrow into a beautiful flower. You decide to do the same for the rest. Soon the tears of sorrow turn to tears of joy, as each time a plant is reborn, leaves appear on the honey tree again, and your hive revives. Your garden slowly becomes as lush and marvelous as it was before.
