## RDV with Pierre
(note here)

## Q&A with Pierre
- We had a problem with Build and Run the game on Oculus. It turnd out to be an error with the naming of project.
  - Solution: Project Setting - Player - Change the Company & Product Name - Deselect "Override Default Pakage Name"

- We added a script machine on "teardrop" in "Graph" mode, in which we couldn't get local asserts.
  - Solution1: Use "Embed" mode with the same full script
  - Solution2: Use "Embed" mode on the teardrop, and create another "reusable" Graph script as a Subgraph

## Project plan
- We created a TODO list.
- Wed & Thu, We plan to do more about script machines, animation, headset test, and we'll create more asserts.
- And we'll do the paintings and the polish of models in this weekend.

## in the Scene
- We did a first draft of the scene, with 4 small plants around a big honey tree.
- The scene is a bit empty at the moment.
- We don't have objects in decadence state yet, we will either scan more (which will be difficult to clean) or create models in C4D (probably a better option).

## XR hand demo test
We were following the XR hand demo tutorial to install the XR toolkits in a new 3D URP project. A lot of errors happened. We had to try it on both computers bcs of unexpected problems with bugs and cables. Eventually it worked on Huiwen's mac and we could drag cubes in the scene.
