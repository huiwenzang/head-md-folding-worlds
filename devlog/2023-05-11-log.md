## Morning

This morning we worked on pour pitch. We developped the storyline around our project and ended finding a narration that suits the poetics we aimed for. You can find it under "2023-05-11-pitch.md".
This is our pitch :

"You are a bee witnessing the decay of your world. Withered flowers, dried plants, moldy trees and dusty rocks replaced the lush vegetation of your once beautiful garden. All is not lost though ! Your environment speaks, you only need to listen. Eventually, you'll find out that the missing elements it craves to be revived are very close to you."

The idea here is that you will wander in the garden. This garden will be composed of different individual elements (for exemple a tree, a flower, a bush, a honey hive). Those elements are dying and to revive them you first need to approach them and listen to the noise they make. Each noise corresponds to a silhouette you'll find on the exterior of the structure surrounding the garden. The goal is to find the matching silhoutte of the dying element and unite it to it's physical missing part to revive it. To have a concrete exemple : if you go near the honey hive that is all dry or moldy, you'll hear the sound of a bee (bzzzz) then you'll get out of the structure and find the silhouette of the bee and unite it (don't know how yet) with the honey hive to revive it, for it to be healthy again. The goal is to do this with every element of the garden until it's fully revived.

## Afternoon

in the afternoon we went to buy physical elements for our garden : paper, underlay and metal sponge.

We also went to the prototype workshop to get an appointment on monday. We want to use a laser cutter to cut our silhouettes into MD wood planes or plexiglass. Then we will assemble the cube (our structure). We will discuss at the end of the day, during our 1 to 1 interviews with douglas to see if i'ts possible to jump the scanning part of the structure and only model in 3D.

We are looking for endangered vegetation on internet to have the basis of our garden. Because the idea is that this dyiing garden is composed of real life dying vegatation.
