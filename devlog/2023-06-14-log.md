### Animation

After we applied all the materials on the 5 stages of the big tree, Elie continued working on the the morphing of materials of the tree and leaves. And he linked each stage of transformation of all the plants, and the result turned out well. He tried to rearrange the scene to make it more logical for users to walk in the designed path. Also Elie paid a lot of effort to polish the animation effects of transformation.

### Sound

Huiwen recorded more voices and edited them to make a concert of the garden where bees live.

The idea is, firstly, there are sound effects for events. Secondly, there is a background music containing the sound of bee, wind, and teardropping with different pitches and frequencies. Last but not least,as whenever a plant is revived, there's sound for more living creatures' coming back. More importantly, more sound of bees are returning as the beehive's rescued.

However, Huiwen found out the sound clips she recorded has too much bird sound as the birds were singing a lot outside the school window. Due to the limitation of this course, that we could only make sound with mouth, Huiwen decided not to use them.

Eventually, She recorded again everything in the elevator, which has much better soundblock.
