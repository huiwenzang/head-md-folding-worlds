### Animation

After all the objects are fixed and painted. Elie continued working on the the animation in the scene. He tested a lot with creating prefabs in several ways and eventually figured out the transformation of the difeerent colors of sponges in script machines. Then he worked on the transformation of each other objects, which turned out well.

He added a particle system as well which would then be used as smoke. But the fog lingring around the plants didn't seem to make much sense. So we decided to make glittering effects which would look like bees flying around.

### Sound

Huiwen started recording voices. She Starts with making a normal bee sound. Then she tried to add tones to the bee sound and sing. At last she selected some clips and edited the pitch and speed, resulted in 3 sound effect: normal bee sound, small sucess bee sound, victory bee sound.

She tried to make sound of water with voice but the results were not good.
