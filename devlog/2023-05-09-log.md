## Context
### conversation
Take the example of the iceberg that's gonna be melted in the future, (snapshot) find a central actor (bees?) and a cycle to create our narration :
for instance if we take the bees exemple -> if there is no bees, there is no trees, no flowers, no animals, and ultimatelz no humans.

Let's make a design fiction!

Now Huiwen asked : then there's nothing ? only stones. Everything is dead. To what Elie answered : well we don't need to go that far on the timeline (oblivious death)  we can go somewhere in the middle. Then Wen said : ah! so we can see the past and future at the same time.

So now we need to find this actor.. is it the bees ? or something else. Also we need to start building smth so yeah that was our morning until now (11.06).
