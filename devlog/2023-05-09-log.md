## chat with Camille
- choose the scene (imaginative/ecological/...)
- iceberg, archive, future
- gesture, zoom in/out, ant
- pitch:...

## Context
### conversation
Take the example of the iceberg that's gonna be melted in the future, (snapshot) find a central actor (bees?) and a cycle to create our narration :
for instance if we take the bees exemple -> if there is no bees, there is no trees, no flowers, no animals, and ultimatelz no humans.

Let's make a design fiction!

Now Huiwen asked : then there's nothing ? only stones. Everything is dead. To what Elie answered : well we don't need to go that far on the timeline (oblivious death)  we can go somewhere in the middle. Then Wen said : ah! so we can see the past and future at the same time.

So now we need to find this actor.. is it the bees ? or something else. Also we need to start building smth so yeah that was our morning until now (11.06).

## Inspirations
- Floating Worlds
- Ukiyo-e (pictures of the floating world) 
- Shan shui (mountain-water paintings)
- Chinese garden
- Hanging garden of babylon
- Air/Water/Qi (mist)
- lots of pictures

## Moodboard
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(pictures)

## Ideas
### Ecosystem of missing things/"floating" things
- garden with no plants and trees
- beehives with no bees
- trays of fungi
- flowers no pollen
- cows with no life?

### Immersive/floating environment
- in the "garden" of missing things
- background/distance: shadows of waht's in the past
- surroundings: mist and the temporary objects 

## Maquette
- Containter: a box with the silhouettes of missing things (bees, leaves...)
- Objects Inside: hanging the space, surrounded by mists
  jars, beehive, branches...
