We need to do a clean version of our scketches - those from tuesday were brainstorming and aren't that clear.
Ou maquette evolved (pictures below) - Our intention might be clearer now.

## feedback by Douglas

"Still a work to do but I see where you are going."
Also gave the idea to scan one hexagon from the bee comb so we can have something uniform that we can use as a prefab on unity.

## Maquette

So, the box we had yesterday evolved "more" into ou image reference for the outside (check devlog 09). We also worked on the inside part of the withered (fl√©tri) garden.
