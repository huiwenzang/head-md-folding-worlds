# Weekend
On Friday morning, Elie cleaned the rest of the scans (Honey, Fringed Orchid, 4 kind of Leaves, Small tree) and sent them to me. 

On Friday afternoon and Saturday morning, I cleaned their shapes more and fixed the problems with the mesh. Also, I cleaned the scan of Black Cohosh. I reduced their polygons and sent them to Elie to paint the textures.

On Sunday, Elie tried to paint the .fbx with low polygons but failed. They look weird in Substance. He tried to increase the polygons to get a better mesh but it didn't work. But he painted a small tree which has a high polygon file.

# Monday
## Tutorial
We were learning the state machine tutorial most of the day.
I set up the XR tools in Unity. We'll test it tomorrow.

## Plan
We discussed about the project.md document.

## Asserts
To continue the story with the .fbx asserts from the weekend. With the small tree we had, we imported it in Unity and tried to apply the materials on it. It worked well. 

After that I exported the honey.fbx with high polygons and tried to paint them in Substance. But the baking faild. I realized it was a problem with the mesh I drew. So I got back to C4D and remesh it. And it worked. However, with the Unity game (tutorials) running on my computer, I could barely work with Substance. So We're gonna do the paintings later on Elie's PC or on the big computer next door. 

After the test I remeshed everything we had, and exported them in both high & low polygons.
