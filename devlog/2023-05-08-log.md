## Inspirations
- Floating Worlds
- Ukiyo-e (pictures of the floating world) 
- Shan shui (mountain-water paintings)
- Chinese garden
- ...

## Concept
- "the visible is subordinated to the higher purpose of making sensible what is absent"

## Questions
- What is visible ?
- What is absent for our project ?

## Ideas

### Visual
- building the maquette with temporary things like cigs..?
- the trace of things
- mixing nature and urban : beehive in concrete texture mixed with organic natural texture

### Ecosystem of missing things
- garden with no plants and trees
- beehives with no bees
- trays of fungi
- flowers no pollen
- cows with no life?

## Interaction: Visual x Sound
- when you select one object like beehive for exemple you can hear the sound of what is missing (the bees)
