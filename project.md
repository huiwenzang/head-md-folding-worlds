# Last Bee Standing

## Pitch
?????????? A 500 character (or less!) description of the project. 

A bee returns to a barren garden after a long absence, reviving it with tears of nostalgia. The miraculous rebirth inspires the bee and its hive to restore the lushness of their sanctuary, showcasing resilience and the transformative power of nature.

## Synopsis
?????????? This is a "1 pager" that explains all the basics in one page. This is a text-based description of the project with maybe one illustration that accompagnies the text.

You are a bee that hasn't been home in a long time and decide to come back. As you arrive in the garden where your hive resides you discover that everything has died while you were away. You pick up a remain of the garden and burry it in the ground as a last homage. While the water of your tears of nostalgia touch the soil, you realise with that the remain had regrown into a beautiful flower. You decide to do the same with the other remains. Soon tears of sadness become tears of joy as you realise that everytime a plant is reborn, the main tree and your hive are being restored : slowly leafs are appearing again on the branches and bees start to come back. Together you start rebuilding this garden until it's as lush and marvelous as it was before you left.


## Visual Interaction Loop
?????????? There should be *one simple basical funamental interaction loop* to your project. Please describe this fundamental interaction in a paragraph.

- There is a drop of water (still) in your sight, each time you drag and drop it on the dead plant, the plant got revived and turns into a live plant.
