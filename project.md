## Pitch
A 500 character (or less!) description of the project. 

You are a bee who returns home after a long while and finds everything has died in the garden where your hive resides. You pay your last homage with tears in eyes. However, as the tears fall to the ground, the remains miraculously regrow into a beautiful flower. You decide to do the same for the rest. Soon the tears of sorrow turn to tears of joy, as each time a plant is reborn, leaves appear on the tree again, and your hive revives. Your garden slowly becomes as lush and marvelous as before.

(Before: You are a bee that hasn't been home in a long time and decide to come back. As you arrive in the garden where your hive resides you discover that everything has died while you were away. You pick up a remain of the garden and burry it in the ground as a last homage. While the water of your tears of nostalgia touch the soil, you realise with that the remain had regrown into a beautiful flower. You decide to do the same with the other remains. Soon tears of sadness become tears of joy as you realise that everytime a plant is reborn, the main tree and your hive are being restored : slowly leafs are appearing again on the branches and bees start to come back. Together you start rebuilding this garden until it's as lush and marvelous as it was before you left.)

## Visual Interaction Loop
There should be *one simple basical funamental interaction loop* to your project. Please describe this fundamental interaction in a paragraph.

- Palm up, a drop of water (your tears) falls on your hand. You place it on the remains of a dead plant and it revives into a living plant. Meanwhile, in the middle of the garden, the honey tree grows a few leaves and becomes a bit healthier.

## POV
